## Weather App

### React/Redux

After cloning the repo, change into the directory

- Run `npm install` to install the dependendies
- Run `npm run start` to start the application at `http://localhost:3000`
- ~~Run `npm run test` to run unit tests~~

Once launched, you will be presented with an input field that takes zip codes. Adding a valid zip code will create a new 5 day forecast for that location. Clicking on any of the days will take you to a detail page about that day. Simply click the `go back` button to return to the fulll forecast screen.

You may add as many locations as you want.
